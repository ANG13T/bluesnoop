- Keep track of the devices 
- Adding notes 
- Manufacturer OUI Lookup: 
- Automatically resolve the first three bytes of the MAC address to identify the brand (e.g., "Apple, Inc." or "Samsung"). This helps you scan the room for specific hardware.
- Signal "Heartbeat" Logging: Track how long a device has been present. If a device disappears for 2 minutes and returns, it’s likely a person who left the room and came back.
- RSSI Proximity Alert: Set a "perimeter." If a new, unknown device crosses a specific RSSI threshold (meaning it’s very close to you), the utility triggers a sound or a flash.
- Triangulation via Walking (Dead Reckoning): Since you only have one sensor (your laptop), you can click a button that says "Mark My Location." You move 5 meters, click it again. The software uses the difference in RSSI from Point A and Point B to pinpoint the device's exact $(x, y)$ coordinate.
- Export to any file format (CSV, JSON, XML) for later analysis.
- Real-time updating TUI with Ratatui
